\description{
Time series of rainfall totals from the Perrine 4W gauge, ocean-side water levels at control structure S-20, and groundwater at Well G-3356 (with missing values interpolated using groundwater levels at Well G-3355).
Ocean-side water levels and groundwater levels were each detrended using a 3-month moving average window.
