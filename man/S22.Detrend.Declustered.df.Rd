A data frame with 26,067 rows and 4 variables:
\describe{

\item{Rainfall}{Rainfall totals (inches)}
\item{OsWL}{Ocean-side water levels (ft NGVD29)}

\description{
Time series of rainfall totals from the Miami International Airport gauge, ocean-side water levels at control structure S-22, and groundwater at Well G-580A (with missing values interpolated using groundwater levels at Well G-860).
All time series were declustered using a peaks-over-threshold approach (runs method with a 0.98 quantile threshold and a 3-day separation criterion).
Ocean-side water levels and groundwater levels were each detrended using a 3-month moving average window prior to declustering.
