Description: The `MultiHazard` package provides tools for stationary
    multivariate statistical modeling, for example, to estimate the joint
    distribution of MULTIple co-occurring HAZARDs. The package contains
    functions for pre-processing data including imputing missing values,
    detrending and declustering time series as well as analyzing pairwise
    correlations over a range of lags. Functionality is also built in to
    impliment the conditional sampling - copula theory approach in Jane et
    al. (2020) including the automated threshold selection approach in
    Solari et al. (2017). Tools are provided for selecting the best
    fitting amongst an array of (non-extreme, truncated and non-truncated)
    parametric marginal distributions, and, copulas to model the
    dependence structure. The package contains a function that calculates
    joint probability contours using the method of overlaying
    (conditional) contours given in Bender et al. (2016), and extracting
    design events such as the 'most likely' event or an ensemble of
    possible design events. The package also provides the capability of
    fitting and simulating synthetic records from three higher dimensional
    approaches - standard (elliptic/Archimedean) copulas, Pair Copula
    Constructions (PCCs) and the conditional threshold exceedance approach
    of Heffernan and Tawn (2004). Finally, a function that calculates the
    time for a user-specified height of sea level rise to occur under
    various scenarios is supplied.
